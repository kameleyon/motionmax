# Phase 2 Major Triage (2026-05-10)

Source: walked `360roadmap.md` Appendix "## Major (318 findings)" — the
section after Phase 2 cluster summary on lines 243-255 expands into
explicit per-finding tables (lines 775-1194). Every triage row below
was verified against the live tree at HEAD (`e1fa0a1`) and against the
22 Phase-0 / 75 Phase-1 closure waves logged in `git log --oneline`.

**Total bullets audited**: 240 (deduplicated — some findings repeat
across reviewer cuts, e.g. emoji-vs-Lucide appears in §1 Canon and §1
Proof; counted once per row).

**Partial**: 41
**Remaining**: 135

# Summary counts

**Total bullets**: 240
- ✅ done: **64** (~27%)
- ⚠️ partial: **41** (~17%)

The Critical waves incidentally closed roughly one-quarter of Phase 2
Major — strongest in §1 a11y (4 of 12), §5 perf (3 of 9), §6 crypto

watermark + UTM where v2-Blocker scope already touched the surface.

The biggest blind spots are §1 design system (10 of 11 remaining), §3

# Top 10 Highest-Leverage Remaining (judgment call)

Effort × user impact × audit-recurrence:

1. **M-A1 projectUtils inline bypass** (M) — 15 inline `=== "smartflow"` checks. One helper file + sed replaces them. Eliminates the most-repeated audit finding across reviewers.
2. **M-3 No connection-status badge outside admin** (L) — All realtime hooks already expose `connection` state; promoting the admin pattern is one shared hook + one chip component. Unlocks user-facing "your connection dropped" UX everywhere.
3. **M5 No referral-conversion event + tracking plan doc** (S+S) — Two small wins: write `docs/tracking-plan.md` + add `referral_code` to `signup_completed` and `begin_checkout` trackEvent calls. Closes the entire §11 analytics blind spot.
4. **F-A11Y-021 Skip-link on app-shell** (S) — 5-line change in `WorkspaceLayout.tsx`. Closes WCAG 2.4.1 gap that ADA-suit plaintiffs scan for.
5. **Lifecycle email copy rewrite** (S × 5) — Welcome subject, body, payment-failed, cancellation, greeting fallback. Single PR. Conversion math says these are worth weeks of A/B testing once they ship.
6. **Sitemap + robots crawl-delay + canonical www-vs-apex** (XS × 3) — Three trivial SEO fixes (`generate-sitemap.mjs`, delete one robots line, unify hreflang). New domain; every week of stale `lastmod` costs crawl budget.
7. **GPC handling + cookie banner copy + CCPA Notice at Collection** (S+S+M) — Three CCPA/EU items in one legal-page PR. CNIL fines fire without warning here.
8. **M-A4 IntakeForm progressive disclosure** (L) — Already 1416 lines; the `steps/` scaffold exists; finish the migration. Reduces signup → first-render funnel drop-off — the highest-leverage TTFV lever in §3.
9. **F-D6 + L-M-13 + L-M-05 + L-M-09 legal/data trio** (S+M+M+M) — `subscriptions.plan_name` CHECK + California Notice at Collection + Art. 22 disclosure + Stripe webhook retention. One legal/migration PR.
10. **M-7 + M-9 + M-8 worker-side realtime hardening** (XS × 3) — Three trivial fixes (`pollWorkerJob` id check, `useActiveJobs` filter, signout-removeAllChannels). Closes the §7 realtime cluster's quick wins without touching the optimistic-UI L items.

Estimated effort: ~5-6h. ~30 items.

## Wave D — Code health refactor + perf (Arch + Prism)
**Scope**: `src/lib/projectUtils.ts` + ~15 callsites (M-A1), pick one Sidebar + delete the other (M-A3), one pipeline + delete the other (M-A6), `src/components/intake/IntakeForm.tsx` finish step split (M-A4), `src/pages/VoiceLab.tsx` feature-folder extraction (M-A5), gate admin TODOs (M-A7), `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx`/`RightRail.tsx`/`Hero.tsx`/`ProjectsGallery.tsx` `React.memo` (PERF-017), `src/App.tsx` move modals from global mount (PERF-019), `src/pages/Landing.tsx` remove `console.log` (PERF-018 + 1.6), uninstall `recharts` package (PERF-020 cleanup), Lighthouse CI cover landing + pricing not just admin (PERF-014), `src/main.tsx` chunk-load failure handler (F15).

Estimated effort: ~6-8h. ~13 items. Lower agent parallelism — these touch the same render tree.

## Wave E — Legal + i18n + CI hardening (Comply + Tongue + Pipeline)
**Scope**: `src/pages/Privacy.tsx` + `marketing/src/pages/privacy.astro` (DSAR 30/45, Art. 22, COPPA, Notice at Collection, DPF claim verification, retention table), `src/components/CookieConsent.tsx` (ICO-strict copy), new `/cookie-policy` route, GPC handling in `src/lib/analytics`, Stripe checkout `custom_fields` for EU cooling-off waiver (`supabase/functions/create-checkout`), `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (new), `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` (new), `.github/workflows/dr-restore-test.yml` (new), `.github/workflows/storage-backup.yml` (new), `.husky/pre-push` (new), `.github/dependabot.yml` (new), pin 8 Edge Function Sentry URLs + worker `@sentry/node`, drop `lovable-tagger`, `vercel.json` Supabase URL env-driven, schedule storage lifecycle cron (KEEPER-08), `subscriptions.plan_name` CHECK migration.

Estimated effort: ~6-8h. ~25 items. Two sub-waves possible (legal/docs vs CI/IaC) since they touch disjoint files.

## Items left out of waves (deferred — higher cost or lower clarity)

- **§7 Realtime + state** large items (M-5 optimistic UI, M-3 status badge) — touch the editor render tree; defer behind Wave D's IntakeForm refactor to avoid conflict.
- **§10 Ghost edge cases** — 15 items; mostly belong inside the Wave D refactor sequence or as targeted L items requiring test-first.
- **§4/§5/§7 Backend (Forge F-CH/F-PF)** — worker code; cluster into a dedicated "worker hardening" wave after Wave D lands.
- **F-A11Y-015 caption tracks** — pending worker VTT generation pipeline (already flagged C-1-11 partial).
- **TONGUE-04 RTL plumbing + TONGUE-13 email i18n + TONGUE-14 multi-currency** — all L items; not viable until i18n runtime lands.
- **§8 Crash 6, 11, 12, 13** — worker-side; bundle with Forge wave.

## §10 Ghost edge cases — execution (2026-05-10) — DONE

| Item | Status | Location |
|---|---|---|
| G-M1 (S) scheduleRefresh uncancellable timeouts | FIXED | `useSceneRegen.ts:96-127` — Set-tracked timer refs + unmount cleanup |
| G-M2 (S) Auth lockout state lost on refresh | FIXED | `Auth.tsx:30-58,140,367,374` — sessionStorage persist + TTL self-clean |
| G-M3 (S) ScheduleBlock cross-tab DRAFT_KEY leak | FIXED | `ScheduleBlock.tsx:55-86` — per-tab UUID discriminator |
| G-M4 (S) useExport subscribe-after-insert race | FIXED | `useExport.ts:152-225` — subscribe + await SUBSCRIBED before INSERT |
| G-M5 (M, worker) Reaper revives master_audio = double-bill | TODO-DEFERRED | `staleClaimReaper.ts:104-128` — needs `billed_at` column + test harness |
| G-M6 (S) Topic-gen 1.5s × 5min polling | FIXED | `ScheduleBlock.tsx:87-99,329-365` — exponential backoff 1.5s→30s |

| G-M10 (XS) autopost_rerender not in refund classifier | FIXED | `refundCreditsOnFailure.ts:41-58,65-69` — added to REFUNDABLE_TASK_TYPES |
| G-M11 (M, worker) withTransientRetry idempotency | TODO-DEFERRED | `index.ts:199-224` — needs attempt-aware idempotency key |
| G-M12 (S) applyCaptionsAll schema-cache silent drop | FIXED | `useSceneRegen.ts:765-820` — toast.warning on cache miss, error on real DB fail |
| G-M13 (M) IntakeRail 200ms heavy effect | NOT-APPLICABLE | Audit description doesn't match current `IntakeRail.tsx` — no 200ms loop exists |
| G-M14 (S) Two-tab applyCaptionsAll double export | FIXED | `useSceneRegen.ts:732-758,842-848` — per-project lease lock w/ 10min TTL |
| G-M15 (S) cancelPolling doesn't abort insert | FIXED | `useExport.ts` + `ScheduleBlock.tsx` — AbortController plumbed through |

**Tests added:** `useBeforeUnload.test.ts` (5 tests), `refundCreditsOnFailure.test.ts` (+3 G-M10 tests). 188 vitest tests pass.

## Task #83 RLS-PUBLIC-leak followups — execution (2026-05-10) — DONE

Migration `supabase/migrations/20260510280000_rls_public_leak_audit.sql` applied to prod (project `ayjbvcikuwknqdrpsdmj`):

- `auth_events`, `generation_costs`, `api_call_logs`, `admin_logs` all: `ENABLE + FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, `REVOKE ALL FROM anon/authenticated/PUBLIC`, `GRANT ALL TO service_role`, dynamic drop of all historic policies, two new policies per table (one RESTRICTIVE + one PERMISSIVE both scoped `TO service_role`), trailing `DO $verify$` block that RAISEs if any anon/authenticated/PUBLIC grant remains.
- **Anon curl verification (production):** all 4 return `{"code":"42501","message":"permission denied for table ..."}`.
- **Worker/Edge Function regression check**: every read/write to these 4 tables already goes through `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (worker via `worker/src/lib/supabase.ts`, edge functions via `Deno.env`). No anon-key access found. **No regressions.**
- `auth_events` decision: locked to service_role only — table is a scaffold for a future session-derivation feature; no anon INSERT path exists yet.
- **§9 Watch M1 SLO definitions, M5 cost spike alerting** — require product input on thresholds.
